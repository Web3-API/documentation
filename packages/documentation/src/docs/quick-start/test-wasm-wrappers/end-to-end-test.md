title: Writing tests with TypeScript
---

## **Introduction**

Here we discuss the process of writing end to end (e2e) tests for your Wasm wrapper using TypeScript. 
By end-to-end, we mean tests that make calls to the wrapper through a Polywrap Client. 
E2e testing is both necessary and useful. 
It is necessary because calls between wrappers depend on the Polywrap Client, and therefore cannot always be made in a 
Wasm wrapper's native language. 
It is useful because such tests can more accurately represent the user experience of your wrapper when it is integrated 
into an application.

We will focus on setting up a test environment and a Polywrap Client. Once these tasks are completed, testing
a Wasm wrapper is similar to testing a traditional SDK.

## **Prerequisites**

This guide uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to implement the Polywrap test environment. We will also
use the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) testing framework, though you can use any framework and follow without difficulty.

:::tip
In the future, TypeScript will be one of many supported languages with a Polywrap client.
As more Polywrap Clients are released in various languages, implementing plugin wrappers in those languages will be supported as well.
:::

You'll need the following installed as developer dependencies before testing your wrapper:

- [`polywrap`](../../reference/cli/polywrap-cli)
- [`@polywrap/test-env-js`](../../reference/clients/js/libraries/test-env-js)
- [`@polywrap/client-js`](../../reference/clients/js/client-js)
- `jest`
- `@types/jest`

These can be added to your TypeScript project using the npm or yarn package managers:
```
npm install --save-dev polywrap @polywrap/test-env-js @polywrap/client-js jest @types/jest
```
```
yarn add -D polywrap @polywrap/test-env-js @polywrap/client-js jest @types/jest
```

## **The Polywrap Test Environment**

An ideal Polywrap test environment will integrate everything you need to test your wrapper. 
In the case of this guide, we will need an IPFS node and an Ethereum test network.

:::tip
Polywrap makes it easy to create a custom test environment that you can start and stop with the Polywrap CLI.
See [Configure Polywrap infrastructure pipeline](./infra-pipeline) for more information.
:::

This guide will use the [`@polywrap/test-env-js`](../../reference/clients/js/libraries/test-env-js) package.
The `@polywrap/test-env-js` package uses the default infrastructure module included with the [`polywrap`](../../reference/cli/polywrap-cli) CLI.
We can use `@polywrap/test-env-js` to start and stop the test environment programmatically. 
The package also exports the ethereum provider, ipfs provider, and ens addresses used by the default infrastructure module.

## **Starting and stopping a Polywrap Test environment with @polywrap/test-env-js**

If you're unfamiliar with [`@polywrap/test-env-js`](../../reference/clients/js/libraries/test-env-js), feel free to check 
out the reference documentation before we continue.

Let's start a new file where we will write our first test. 

Like many testing frameworks in JavaScript, the Jest framework includes hooks that run before and after all tests. 
I've added a call to `initTestEnvironment` in the `beforeAll` hook, so we can start our test environment before running our tests. 
I added a call to `stopTestEnvironment` in the `afterAll` hook to make sure the test environment does not continue running 
on our system after we finish testing.

```typescript
$snippet: js-e2e-test-init
```

## **Building and deploying a Wasm wrapper for testing with @polywrap/test-env-js**

To invoke a Wasm wrapper in a test, we first need to build it. In this guide, we will do this with 
`@polywrap/test-env-js` using the `buildWrapper` function.

:::tip
Alternatively, we could have used the `@polywrap/test-env-js` function `buildAndDeployWrapper`.
The `buildAndDeployWrapper` function will build a wrapper, deploy it to IPFS, point an ENS domain to it.
It returns both the IPFS content hash and the ENS domain, either of which could be used to invoke the wrapper.
:::

The `buildWrapper` function requires an absolute path to the directory containing the wrapper's polywrap manifest.
We will obtain the absolute path to our wrapper project in three steps. First we get the directory of the folder containing
our test script, using the node.js `__dirname` global variable. We then append the path from our test script file to the
manifest directory. Finally, we import the node.js feature `path`, and use `path.resolve` to get direct absolute path to
our wrapper project.

We will invoke our wrapper using the path to our build folder. 
We prefix the path with `wrap://fs/` to conform to the WRAP URI standard, though prefixing the path with `fs/` alone would
work just as well. See [Understanding URIs](../../concepts/understanding-uris) to learn more.

```typescript
$snippet: js-e2e-test-build
```

## **Setting up a Polywrap Client**

Now that we have deployed our Wasm wrapper to a local test environment, we need to set up a Polywrap Client that can
invoke it. We can make sure our client is ready to invoke the wrapper by configuring two of the default plugin wrappers.

- The `ipfsResolverPlugin` can be configured using the test environment's local IPFS node.
- The `ethereumPlugin` can be configured with an Ethereum provider for the Ganache Ethereum test network.

### **Configure the IPFS Resolver Plugin**

The `ipfsResolverPlugin` can be configured with a default IPFS provider and an array of fallback providers that will be tried if
the default provider fails.

```typescript
$snippet: js-e2e-test-config-ipfs-import

$snippet: js-e2e-test-config-ipfs
```

### **Configure the Ethereum Plugin**

The `ethereumPlugin` can be configured with Ethereum providers and signers. It accepts JSON RPC provider strings, 
Providers from the ethers.js package, and providers from the web3.js package.

To configure the plugin, we need to provide it with an object containing network names along with a provider. We can
optionally provide a signer as well, but by default the plugin will attempt to obtain a signer from the provider if it
is needed.

We can give networks any name we want in our configuration. We can later use these names to choose which network to 
query. Here we will use the name "testnet" for our local Ethereum test network.

We also need to tell the Ethereum plugin which network should be used when a network is not specified. We do this by
setting the value of the `defaultNetwork` property to one of our network names.

```typescript
$snippet: js-e2e-test-config-ethereum-import

$snippet: js-e2e-test-config-ethereum
```

### **Create the Polywrap Client Instance**

Now we are ready to add the plugins to our Polywrap Client configuration and create the client. The URI's we assign in
our client configuration will redirect to the plugin instances when queried.

```typescript
$snippet: js-e2e-test-config
```

## **Deploy the Smart Contract**

The SimpleStorage wrapper is designed to interact with a SimpleStorage smart contract. We need to deploy an
instance of the contract to work with. While there are many tools developers can use to deploy a smart contract on a
local network, the SimpleStorage API has a method `deployContract` we can use to get the job done. We'll call it before
running our test to make sure the contract is ready.

```typescript
$snippet: js-e2e-test-deploy
```

## **Generate TypeScript Types**

Since we are using TypeScript, we will want types to work with. It is possible to automatically generate TypeScript
types from a GraphQL schema using the Polywrap CLI's `app` command. 

Let's set up a `polywrap.app.yaml` manifest in a new folder called `types`. 
We will provide the manifest with the path to the composed schema in our build folder.

```yaml title="polywrap.app.yaml"
$snippet: yaml-e2e-test-app-manifest
```

We can then call the `codegen` command of the Polywrap CLI.

```shell
yarn polywrap codegen -m ./src/__tests__/types/polywrap.yaml -g ./src/__tests__/types/wrap
```

The generated output includes TypeScript types for the SimpleStorage wrapper and its imports.

```typescript title="types.ts"
...
$snippet: js-e2e-test-types
...
```

## **Testing a Wrapper Method**

From this point, testing a function in your wrapper is no different from testing a traditional SDK. Instead of calling
a method in a traditional SDK, you will invoke your wrapper.

We will test the `setIpfsData` method we added to the SimpleStorage API in [Adding new functions](../create-wasm-wrappers/tutorial/adding-new-methods). 
For arguments, the `setIpfsData` method takes the Ethereum address of a deployed SimpleStorage contract and the data 
the user wants to add to IPFS. It returns the IPFS hash of the data.

We will test the `setIpfsData` method using the string `"Hello from IPFS!"` as the data for our test case. To be sure
our method returns the correct IPFS hash, we can compare the method's return value to the value we get from the free 
[*File CID Checker*](https://app.pinata.cloud/cidchecker) service provided by [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/).
