A special type of Polywrap project can be used to define an abstract interface without providing a concrete implementation.
Like other wrappers, the interface is defined using a [Wrapper Schema](../wrapper-schema).
Once an interface is written and deployed, other projects can import and implement it.

For example, the [URI Resolver](https://github.com/polywrap/monorepo/tree/origin/packages/interfaces/uri-resolver) 
interface is used to standardize the interface of URI resolvers. 
It is implemented by multiple plugin wrappers to help the Polywrap client query different types of URIs.

## Declaring an interface project

Interface projects are declared using a [Polywrap Manifest](../create-wasm-wrappers/polywrap-manifest).
To indicate that a project is an abstract interface, set the project language to `interface`.

Interface projects do not have a module. Only a [schema](../wrapper-schema) path is declared.

```yaml
format: 0.1.0
name: UriResolver
deploy: ./polywrap.deploy.yaml
language: interface
schema: ./src/schema.graphql
```

## Defining an interface

Defining an interface is as simple as writing the [Wrapper Schema](../wrapper-schema). 
Once the schema is complete, you are ready to deploy the interface wrapper.

## Implementing an interface

As described in [Wrapper Schema](../wrapper-schema#interfaces), 
an interface can be imported and then implemented with the `implements` keyword. 
When a module `implements` an interface module, it inherits all of its method declarations.

The [ENS Resolver](https://github.com/polywrap/monorepo/tree/origin/packages/js/plugins/uri-resolvers/ens-resolver) plugin
implements the [URI Resolver](https://github.com/polywrap/monorepo/tree/origin/packages/interfaces/uri-resolver) interface
and inherits its methods.
