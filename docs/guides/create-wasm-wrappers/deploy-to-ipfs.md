There are multiple ways that can be used to deploy your newly created wrapper package
to IPFS, enabling other apps to integrate your wrapper:

## `wrappers` CLI
[`wrappers`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nerfzael/wrappers) is a command-line tool for publishing polywrappers to IPFS and ENS. IPFS publishing is done via a [wrap-persistence-node endpoint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nerfzael/wrap-persistence-node). By default it publishes to the public https://ipfs.wrappers.io endpoint.
