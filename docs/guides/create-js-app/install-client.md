## **Introduction**

If you're a JavaScript developer building Browser, Node.js, or React based apps, this guide is for you.

:::tip
In the future, JavaScript will be one of many supported languages. Our goal is to enable the use of Polywraps in every major programming language.

By the end of this document, you'll gain the following skills:

- How to instantiate the Polywrap client in your JavaScript App
- Query any Polywrap using the Polywrap client
- Configure custom Polywrap URI redirects
- Build React apps with ease

If you get stuck during this guide, send us a message on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Z5m88a5qWu)!

## **Prerequisites**

As prerequisites for this guide, we recommend having familiarity with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). [React](https://reactjs.org/) will also be used in the latter sections.

## **Installation**

To use Polywraps in your app, all you need is the Polywrap Client!

```
npm install --save @web3api/client-js
```

The Polywrap JavaScript Client works in both Node.js, and browser applications.

:::warning
Currently Chrome and Brave are the only supported browsers. This restriction will be removed very shortly.
:::

> The next section assumes that you're integrating Polywrap into an existing app project. If you want a quick start with our template project, simply run:
>
> ```bash
> npx @web3api/cli create app typescript-react <project-name>
> ```
>
> Where `<project-name>` is replaced with a custom name of your choosing. For example `my-web3api`.
>
> This command will create a new project folder with a "Hello World" app that
> lets you interact with a simple Polywrap at `ens/helloworld.web3api.eth`.
