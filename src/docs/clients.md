A Client is any library that can resolve and invoke [Wraps](./concepts/wraps).

The Polywrap Foundation maintains a number of Clients, most notably:

- [Polywrap JS Client](https://github.com/polywrap/javascript-client)
- [Polywrap Python Client](https://polywrap-client.readthedocs.io)
- [Polywrap Rust Client](https://github.com/polywrap/rust-client)
- [Polywrap Swift Client](https://github.com/polywrap/swift-client)
- [Polywrap Kotlin Client](https://github.com/polywrap/kotlin-client)

Other clients:
- [Polywrap Go Client](https://github.com/polywrap/go-client)

More clients are in development, such as a Polywrap C# Client(more soon).
