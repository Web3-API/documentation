You're reading Part One of the [Create Wraps](../introduction) tutorial, where we learn everything you need to know to productively develop Polywrap wraps.

We've written our wrap and tested it. Let's add a readme and deploy to IPFS.

## **Add a Readme**

Users can add descriptive metadata to their wraps by adding a `polywrap.docs.yaml` documentation manifest. We won't discuss the full breadth of the documentation manifest here, but we'll use it to add a readme file that will be published with our wrap package.

```yaml title="polywrap.docs.yaml"
format: 0.1.0
readme: ./README.md
```

```markdown title="README.md"
// Write a readme for your wrap here.
```

For the Polywrap CLI to recognize our documentation manifest, we need to add the extension to our `polywrap.yaml` file.

```yaml title="polywrap.yaml"
format: 0.3.0
project:
  name: template-wasm-as
  type: wasm/assemblyscript
source:
  module: ./src/index.ts
  schema: ./polywrap.graphql
extensions:
  build: ./polywrap.build.yaml
  docs: ./polywrap.docs.yaml
```

## **Deploy to IPFS**

Deploying a wrap to IPFS couldn't be easier. With the `polywrap deploy` command in the Polywrap CLI, the CLI will by default automatically upload and pin your wrap to `https://ipfs.wrappers.io`. This is a free service provided by Polywrap to make it easy to deploy and use wraps.

```shell-session
polywrap deploy
```

## **Final Thoughts**

You've come so far and learned so much. You've built a wrap, tested it, and deployed it to IPFS. You're ready to share your wrap with the world!
